# Summary

The [ODRIOD-C4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c4/) is the latest
addition to the line of SBCs from Hardkernel. It is priced at \$50 and comes
packed with high performance parts including the Amlogic S905X3 quadcore ARM64 (
cortex-a55 ) CPU, 4GB DDRR4 DRAM, 4 USB-3.0 ports, GigE, HDMI 2.0, and a 40-pin
GPIO header to list a few key features.

# Porting the Yoe Distribution

Since the Yoe distribution is based on OpenEmbedded, we can take advantage of
the layered architecture where the Odroid board support is added via a BSP
overlay layer. Therefore the effort was focused on adding necessary bits to
meta-odroid.

## New Cortex-a55 tune files

OpenEmbedded allows us to optimize SOC flags to squeeze the best performance out
of the compiler. A new tune file to enumerate cortex-a55 specific tuning options
was added:

```

DEFAULTTUNE ?= "cortexa55"

TUNEVALID[cortexa55] = "Enable Cortex-A55 specific processor optimizations"
TUNE_CCARGS .= "${@bb.utils.contains('TUNE_FEATURES', 'cortexa55', ' -mcpu=cortex-a55', '', d)}"

require conf/machine/include/arm/arch-armv8a.inc

# Little Endian base configs
AVAILTUNES += "cortexa55 cortexa55-crypto"
ARMPKGARCH_tune-cortexa55             = "cortexa55"
ARMPKGARCH_tune-cortexa55-crypto      = "cortexa55"
TUNE_FEATURES_tune-cortexa55          = "aarch64 cortexa55 crc"
TUNE_FEATURES_tune-cortexa55-crypto   = "aarch64 cortexa55 crc crypto"
PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS_tune-cortexa55             = "${PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS_tune-armv8a-crc} cortexa55"
PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS_tune-cortexa55-crypto      = "${PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS_tune-armv8a-crc-crypto} cortexa55 cortexa55-crypto"
BASE_LIB_tune-cortexa55               = "lib64"
BASE_LIB_tune-cortexa55-crypto        = "lib64"

```

A new machine configuration file to define default tuning and pin
kernel/bootloader versions was
[created](https://github.com/YoeDistro/meta-odroid/blob/master/conf/machine/odroid-c4.conf):

## Machine Configuration

```
#@TYPE: Machine
#@NAME: odroid-c4
#@DESCRIPTION: Machine configuration for odroid-c4 systems
#@MAINTAINER: Armin Kuster <akuster808@gmail.com>

DEFAULTTUNE ?= "cortexa55-crypto"

require conf/machine/include/arm/tune-cortexa55.inc
require conf/machine/include/amlogic-meson64.inc
require conf/machine/include/odroid-arm-defaults.inc
...

```

## Recipes for Kernel and Bootloader

While upstream support for Amlogic SOCs is found in the mainline kernel and
Hardkernel added support for the C4 into 4.9, we still needed to update recipes
and add support for a few of the C4 peripherals. Eventually it might be good to
upstream these changes. Similarly, the recipe for u-boot 2015.01 is added since
that is the officially supported bootloader from Hardkernel.

- [Kernel](https://github.com/akuster/meta-odroid/blob/master/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-hardkernel_6.9.bb)
- [boot loader](https://github.com/akuster/meta-odroid/blob/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-hardkernel_2015.01.bb)

# Yoe Distribution port

Yoe distribution has a
[setup script](https://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro/blob/master/envsetup.sh)
to do workspace setup, and a new file (which is just a symlink) to use ODROID-C4
is added as
[odroid-c4-hardkernel-envsetup](https://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro/blob/master/odroid-c4-hardkernel-envsetup.sh)

## Building `yoe-simple-image`

- `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 -b master git://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro.git yoe`
- `cd yoe`
- `. ./odroid-c4-hardkernel-envsetup.sh`
- `yoe_setup`
- `bitbake yoe-simple-image`
- `yoe_install_image /dev/sdX yoe-simple-image`
- `sudo eject /dev/sdX`

power-on and image should boot into console

## Enabling the 3.2 Inch LCD Shield

Using the
[3.2 Inch LCD Shield](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/c1-3-2inch-tfttouchscreen-shield/)
requires enabling it in the device tree and at the same time disabling spidev to
avoid conflicts -- the changes are applied in the kernel via a
[patch](https://github.com/akuster/meta-odroid/blob/master/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-hardkernel-4.9/0001-ODROID-C4-Enable-LCD-and-Touchscreen.patch).

Building `yoe-simple-image` with this change will enable it and `/dev/fb4`
should become available which is implemented in the fb_hktft32 framebuffer
driver.

## Kiosk Broser on the LCD Shield

The QT5 layer for openembedded includes a sample kiosk browser which uses
QTWebengine. To include this in the image, add the following to
`conf/local.conf`:

```
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " qt-kiosk-browser"

```

Bake the image again and flash it to SD card. Once booted, the kiosk browser can
be launched on the LCD using the following commands:

- `export QT_QPA_EGLFS_FB=/dev/fb4`
- `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=linuxfb:fb=/dev/fb4`
- `export QT_QPA_DEBUG=1`
- `export QT_LOGGING_RULES="qt.qpa.*=true"`
- `export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/lib/qt5/qml`
- `export QML_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/lib/qt5/qml`
- `qt-kiosk-browser --no-sandbox /etc/qt-kiosk-browser.conf`

## What Works

X11 over fbdev and the lunuxfb backends work fine. 169MiB of memory is consumed
when using just the Sato UI. After launching the kiosk browser, memory
consumption increases to approximately 225MiB.

## Further work

- Add mali bifrost driver support, which should enable wayland as well as gbm
  eglfs backend
- Support mainline linux kernel and u-boot
