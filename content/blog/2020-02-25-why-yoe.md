## Introduction

Yoe Distribution is intended for creating a deployment template for embedded
linux distribution, it uses OpenEmbedded build system and several tools from
yocto project in the process to establish a fairly, user friendly, reproducible
workflow. The primary focus is on simplicity and ease of use, while maintaining
a robust system, that is reflected in careful selection of tools and processes

## Workspace Setup

We use git submodules to setup full workspace, since git is primary SCM used for
metadata layers and other build artifacts, its easy to use power of git itself
to archive a multi-repository setup, instead of using another external tool to
manage bunch of git repositories

## Docker as builder

Organizations and individuals might have different Linux and non-linux
environments in-house, and adding yet another host operating system prerequisite
is adding to the problem. Instead Yoe distribution employs docker runners, There
is a standard template which is had needed pre-requisites for build Yoe
Distribution packages This also helps in creating a reproducible build
environemnt many years down the lane, when host distros would have moved to
newer verisons and it would be hard to find VMs or machines running specific
distribution on host, that problem has been abstracted with use of containers in
Yoe distributions build environment.

## Setup

Setup is using a shell script to setup OpenEmbedded build environemnt and get it
ready to build. It works with several shells, but bash and zsh are more often
tested, there are additional tools which are provided as builtins in this setup.
The tools help in creating most frequent tasks that are performed by embedded
system builders and developers, e.g. flashing an image, updating the workspace,
setting up local feed server, adding/deleting metadata layers to name a few,
whats more powerful is that it can be extended to local workflow environments by
overriding or adding new functions

## Distribution Feature Policies

Embedded systems have requirements to make custom choices for core components
like, compiler, C library init-systems,grpahics, windowing systems etc. Yoe
distro provides pre-existing templates called `YOE_PROFIILE` to select a
combination of them, at the same time, makes sane choices for other policies
which are requires but are not often marked for selection

## Images

Yoe Distribution provides a few base images, for common usecases

- `yoe-simple-image` - Basic console image
- `yoe-debug-image` - Image with ptests, debug tools, profiling tools this can
  be used for running `-ctestimage` targets
- `yoe-qt5-wayland-image` - Reference image with QT5 samples, e.g.
  cinematicexperience running out of box on wayland/weston
- `yoe-qt5-x11-image` - Same as above, except it uses X11 instead of wayland
- `yoe-qt5-eglfs-image` - Same as above except it does not use X11 or wayland
  but runs on EGLFS directly
- `initramfs-image` - Small image for bundling into kernel as initramfs used as
  updater or recovery
- `yoe-simpleiot-image` - Reference tiny image, suitable for IOT devices

## Reference Machines

Its regularly tested on, `raspberrypi3`,`beaglebone black` along with QEMU
machines for all supported architectures e.g.
ARM/ARM64/x86/x86-64/ppc/mips/mips64/RISCV64/RISCV32
